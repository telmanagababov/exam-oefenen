- Use pipeable operators for better readability and performance
- Implement proper error handling using catchError and throwError
- Utilize shareReplay for multicasting observables and improving performance
- Use async pipe in templates to automatically unsubscribe from observables
- Implement proper subscription management to prevent memory leaks
- Use RxJS schedulers for controlling the execution context of observables
- Leverage RxJS's higher-order mapping operators (mergeMap, switchMap, etc.) for handling nested observables
