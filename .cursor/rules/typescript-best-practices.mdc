- Use strict type checking options in tsconfig.json for better type safety
- Implement interfaces for defining object shapes and service contracts
- Use union types and type guards for handling multiple possible types
- Leverage generics for creating reusable components and services
- Implement readonly properties and readonly arrays to prevent unintended mutations
- Use type assertions cautiously and only when necessary
- Implement proper type inference by using explicit type annotations sparingly
